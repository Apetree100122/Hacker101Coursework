Here's a simple bug report for level 0.  There are
quite a few other bugs to find, so don't
think you can get away with just this one!
Title: Cross-Site Request Forgery
Severity: Critical
Description: The "Transfer Funds" functionality
is vulnerable to CSRF due to no session-specific 
random token being attached to the form.
Reproduction Steps:
1) Go to the Transfer Funds page
2) Submit a funds transfer
3) Note that the only data transmitted is the
destination and the amount.
You can also use the following proof of
concept to submit an automatic transfer:
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
<form action
"http://h101levels.appspot.com/levels/0/method="POST">
<input type
hidden name
amount value
5>
<input 
type
hidden
name to
value 
2>
</form>
</body>
Impact: Due to the simple nature of this 
vulnerability, it's possible for an attacker
to transfer funds from any victim whom he can
convince to access a page controlled by the attacker.  
In this proof of concept, it's done via form autosubmission 
in plain view, but this could be performed in a hidden IFrame
leaving the user no clue that an attack has happened at all.
Mitigation: Proper CSRF tokens should be used on all forms.
